## Overview

The **AI-Powered Blog Generator** is a web application that leverages Groqâ€™s advanced language models to create intelligent, audience-tailored blog posts on a wide range of topics. Whether you're a student, researcher, or someone interested in any topic, this tool generates unique and high-quality blog content instantly, using state-of-the-art language models.

### Features:
- **Audience Selection:** Choose the target audience for the blog: **Common People**, **Students**, or **Researchers**.
- **Creative Control:** Adjust the temperature setting to control the creativity and tone of the generated blog.
- **Downloadable Output:** Generate and download the blog as a `.txt` file for easy sharing or further editing.

## Technologies Used
- **Groq API:** For powerful language model-based text generation.
- **Streamlit:** For creating the interactive web interface.
- **Python:** Backend for handling API requests and user inputs.
